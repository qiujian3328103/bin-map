[Guide for Competency Assessment]
□ Process of Competency Assessment
   Self Assessment → 1st-line Manager Review/Approval → 2nd-line Manager Review/Approval
    ※ 2nd-line manager review is conducted only for competencies that have been marked as Level 4 or Level 5 by the 1st-line manager.

□ How to conduct Self Assessment
1. Please read ‘Definition’ and ‘Behavior Indicator’ of each competency carefully, and select 'Assessment Level' that suits to yourself.
2. If you choose ‘Level 4’ or 'Level 5' for ‘Assessment Level’, a proper rationale should be provided.
  - The rationale you provided should be elaborated based on 5W1H : Who, When, Where, What, Why, and How.
3. By clicking 'Submit', you can complete Self Assessment for all 10 specified competiencies. 
4. If you click ‘Save for later’, it automatically saves the current assessment at ‘Inbox’ where you are able to resume.
5. When your managers decline your self assessment and require more detailed rationale, it is highly recommended to discuss with him/her prior to a resubmission in order to be alinged with what they require.
 

□ How to conduct Manager Review/Approval
1. Read ‘Definition’ and ‘Behavior Indicators’ of each competency, and determine the Assessment Level that suits to the assessment participants.
   ※ Check if the participants have submitted a set of reasons as well for their self assessment at 'Rationale'.
2. Providing feedback from the manager in the 'Rationale' field is highly recommended in the following cases:
    - When assessment Level 4 or Level 5 is to be given to the participants, or when assessment levels chosen by a participant and a manager are not identical. 
   ※ Both the 2nd-line manager and the participants can check the levels which have been given in the 'Rationale' field. 
3. You may click ‘Send Back’ to decline self-assessment if you find the rationale provided insufficient.
